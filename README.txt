Catch the falling orbs of fire to earn experience. The orb cools down each time it bounces off the walls or floor of the glacier. The orb starts off worth +3 points, cools to +1 point, and after two bounces becomes an icy projectile that must be avoided. Use left and right arrows to move and up to jump. Shift changes the game type and allows the down arrow to be used for special abilities!

Version 1: Initial upload.

Version 1.1: Added game modes for two other types. Everything is functional, but I only like the fire type game play. Iâ€™m going to leave the other two types in as an easter egg. The code needs more cleaning and documentation.
